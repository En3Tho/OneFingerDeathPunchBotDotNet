How it works:
1. Start the game
2. Run the bot in the console (preferably with administrator rights) with command 
```powershell
   dotnet run
   ```
3. Position the windows on the display so that they do not overlap
4. In the bot window, press Enter to start the bot
5. Move the cursor to the game area
6. Enjoy

P.S.: It may sometimes be necessary to close any hints, etc., in-game things that are not related to gameplay and that arise during the game.
